Project title
AI-Based Over/Under Predictor for NBA Games

Brief overview of what you are proposing 
We are proposing a full-stack database web app which will be able to predict particular stat lines in the NBA to assist people with sports betting. We aim to construct a fully functional front end which will allow the user to gauge the odds of a particular stat occurrence, as well as provide a list of the top 5 stat lines which are most likely to occur within that game. The front-end will either be coded in HTML or React. For the actual model, we are most likely going to go with a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). We will pull data from the official NBA website and sort it in a .csv file, and have a database to automatically update the data we currently have which games which happen in the future.
